    "This notebook, the final in our series, combines elements of several prior models, including [Basic Capacity Expansion](03-Basic-Capacity-Expansion.ipynb), [Economic Dispatch](04-Economic-Dispatch.ipynb), and a [Network Flow](06-Optimal-Power-Flow.ipynb) model, to demonstrate a more complex capacity expansion planning model that includes chronologically sequential hourly economic dispatch decisions with time coupling constraints (ramp limits and energy storage) and transport flow constraints to represent power transmission limits between multiple geospatial regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that detailed capacity expansion planning models can easily become large-scale constrainted optimization problems that push the limits of computational tractability. As such, these models commonly employ a range of abstraction methods along several dimensions, including temporal resolution, operational detail, and network/geospatial detail."
