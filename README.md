### Description

This course will teach students constrained optimization problems and associated solution methods, how to implement and apply linear and mixed integer linear programs to solve such problems using [Julia](https://julialang.org/)/[JuMP](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/dev/), and the practical application of such techniques in energy systems engineering.

The course will first introduce students to the theory and mathematics of constrained optimization problems and provide a brief introduction to linear programming, including problem formation and solution algorithms.

Finally, to build hands-on experience with optimization methods for energy systems engineering, the course will introduce students to several canonical problems in power and energy systems planning and operations, including: economic dispatch, unit commitment, and capacity planning.
